===================

 * Calculations are parsed to trees and calculated recursively. 
   This is also nice for prices. 
   It's an unbalanced tree (right side is always a number), therefore 
   parallelization of calculations wouldn't be trivial.

 * Controller handles a list of nodes. Is there a _really_ nice way to handle 
   this?
 
 * Node: Wouldn't a logging thread be nicer (and also avoid the ThreadLocal)?

 * How can you deal with assertions (Ã  la "this code should never be reached")
   in a good way?
